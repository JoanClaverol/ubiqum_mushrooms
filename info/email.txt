Good morning guys!

Dr. Michael Thompson, head of the Department of Biology at the Highshire University, has contacted us for help. He wants to develop an application that, given some photographies of a mushroom, can tell to users if it is an edible specie or a poisonous one. 

Attached to this e-mail you will find a csv file with the information collected by his Department, as well as a text file with additional information about this dataset. Your task will consist in develop the best model possible to determine the class of a mushroom (edible or poisonous) taking into account its characteristics.

Good luck!
